##  How It Works
The system uses **hardcoded test cases** in the `main` method to demonstrate all functionalities:
1. Registers multiple users and restaurants.
2. Adds menu items to each restaurant.
3. Searches for items by name.
4. Places orders with different payment methods.
5. Retrieves orders for each user.
6. Cancels an order and shows updated order status.
7. Handles edge cases like insufficient quantity or double cancellation.
